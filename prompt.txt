You are an expert full-stack AI developer. Your task is to **generate a complete Car Marketplace + Rental Platform** from scratch using **React JS frontend** and **Spring Boot backend**, step by step, covering **all phases, features, roles, UI/UX, API standards, error handling, and validations**, in one go. The project should be fully modular, scalable, and production-ready. Export the generated code in a structure ready to run.

## 1. Project Overview

* Platform: Buy, Sell, and Rent Cars
* Users: Buyer, Renter, Seller/Dealer
* Admins: Super Admin, Admin/Moderator
* Roles: Agent/Broker, Support Staff, Finance/Accountant, Content Manager
* Key Principles:

  * API response: `{ "statusCode": <code>, "statusMessage": "<message>", "data": {} }`
  * All codes and messages from centralized constants
  * Backend validates all inputs even if frontend validates
  * Full error handling with global exception handler
  * Use DTOs for requests/responses
  * Frontend should be clean, responsive, and visually appealing

---

## 2. Tech Stack

* Frontend: React JS, JSX, React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS / Chakra UI, Context/Redux
* Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA , Modular architecture
* Database:  MySQL
* Optional: Redis for caching, ElasticSearch for search
* Testing: JUnit (backend), React Testing Library (frontend)
